<div class="icons-4"><p class="hero-text m-1 mw-45 sub m-4">This section is where you'll read about the company. I could've fit the entire text content of this site in the hero section, but why would I do that? It's a lot more fun to make you scroll. I chose to make the background of this section match the color of the button in the hero, because I believe in visual consistancy, that, and hurting your eyes.</p></div><style>.icons-4{display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;flex-direction:column}.icons-4 .hero-text{font-family:"Open sans";color:#333;text-align:center;font-weight:400}</style>
