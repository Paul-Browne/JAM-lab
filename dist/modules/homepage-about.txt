<div class="about">
	<h2 class="hero-text m-1 mw-45 sub m-4">This section is where you'll read about the company. I could've fit the entire text content of this site in the hero section, but why would I do that? It's a lot more fun to make you scroll. I chose to make the background of this section match the color of the button in the hero, because I believe in visual consistancy, that, and hurting your eyes.</h2>
